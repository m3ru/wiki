## My Personal Wiki {#my-personal-wiki}

This is the index of my personal wiki.


## Hiremagalur {#hiremagalur}

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: hiremagalur
:ID:      $(uuidgen)

Does this even work? I'm not convinced that writing in these notes actually makes sense for people to construct their personal wiki with.
To understand the name Hiremagalur: (hire) comes from "Hiriya" or big. (magal) or daughter. (ur) comes from ooru or town. (hiremagalur) or town [of the] eldest daughter

-   Notes chronicling my exploration into Sri Vaishnavam philosophy/religion
    -   Different types of glory-pieces (vailakshaNyam):
        -   vaktru vailakshaNyam: About the glories of the author or speaker (normally refers to AzhvArgaL)
        -   pratipAdya vailakshaNyam: About the glories of the matter which was told from the speaker to the listener
        -   srOtru vaiklakSaNyam: About the glories of the listener, the one who receives the subject matter.

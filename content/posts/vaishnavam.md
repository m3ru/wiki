## Notes chronicling my exploration into Sri Vaishnavam philosophy/religion {#notes-chronicling-my-exploration-into-sri-vaishnavam-philosophy-religion}

-   Different types of glory-pieces (vailakshaNyam):
    -   vaktru vailakshaNyam: About the glories of the author or speaker (normally refers to AzhvArgaL)
    -   pratipAdya vailakshaNyam: About the glories of the matter which was told from the speaker to the listener
    -   srOtru vailakSaNyam: About the glories of the listener, the one who receives the subject matter.
-   emperumAn has sauSIlyam and saulabhyam, meaning amicable nature and ease-of-access.
-   We want to remove dEhAtmAbhimAnam - deha + atma + abhimanam, or giving more importance to the body than the Atma.
-   Some people get jAyamAna kAla katAkSam, or emperumAn's grace at the time of birth such that the reason they are born in a body bound to karms is to enlighten themselves and others about its impermanence.
-   Sanskrit Rules:
    -   bahuvrIhi samAsa -&gt; describing a noun with compound adjectives, such as chakra pANi = vishnu.
    -   sAmAnAdikaraNyam -&gt; multiple objects in a sentence referring to the same thing are in this state of apposition.
        -   Example: in vEdam nAngAy, we have that emperumAn is the four vedas. This instance of sAmAnAdikaraNyam is taken to mean that emperumAn is the giver of the vedas and what is given.
